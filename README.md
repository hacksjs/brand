# Hacks.js brand

**This is a public repository for Hacks.js logos, icons, and other brand artwork.**

## Files

The Hacks.js logo has two forms:

- ### Logotype

  ![](dist/hacksjs-logotype--300x100.svg) \
  Also known as a wordmark, this is a text-based logo that reveals a brand name.

- ### Logomark

  ![](dist/hacksjs-logomark--100x100.svg) \
  Also known as a pictorial mark, this is a logo based on a symbolic image or icon.

There's also a "watermark" version of the logotype, which has a lighter fill colour. All Hacks.js logos are available in a variety of file formats and sizes — see the `dist` directory.
