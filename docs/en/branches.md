# Branches

This repository has two branches:

- `latest/dev` contains documentation for developers and maintainers of this repository
- `latest/release` contains the distributable logos and other brand artwork

Both branches are orphans (created with `git switch --orphan <branch-name>`). They each have separate commit histories that are never merged together.
