# Version numbering

Version numbers for Hacks.js brand artwork loosely follow the [Semantic Versioning](//semver.org) convention.

```txt
v[major].[minor].[patch]
```

- The `[major]` number is bumped to reflect material changes to the Hacks.js brand identity.
- The `[minor]` number is bumped when graphics are released in new file formats, dimensions or sizes.
- The `[patch]` number is bumped when minor edits are made to existing graphics files.

We don't use pre-release suffixes (eg `-beta.0`). However, "version zero" (`v0.x.x`) is considered a pre-release line.
